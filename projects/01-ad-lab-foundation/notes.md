Started Phase 2 - Identity and Access.
Confirmed all four Phase 1 systems remain present in VirtualBox with NAT + Host-Only adapters intact.
Created pre-change snapshots for DC-01 and WINCLIENT-01 before Active Directory deployment.

Prepared DC-01 for Active Directory.
Verified hostname, confirmed static host-only IP 192.168.56.10, installed current Windows updates, and renamed network adapters to NAT and LAB for clarity.

Installed Active Directory Domain Services and DNS on DC-01.
Promoted the server as the first domain controller for a new forest using lab.gregory-dean.com with NetBIOS name LAB.

Validated AD post-promotion state on DC-01.
Confirmed the lab.gregory-dean.com zone exists in DNS, verified AD management consoles are present, and configured DC-01 to use its own internal DNS service on the LAB adapter.

Created a basic OU structure to support identity management and future GPO targeting.
Added Servers, Workstations, Users, Groups, and Admins OUs.

Created initial security groups and test identities in Active Directory.
Added a dedicated labadmin account for administrative tasks and kept privileged membership limited to only what was required for the lab.

Documented core Group Policy basics for the new domain.
Configured domain password policy, set an account lockout threshold of 10, and created a minimal workstation-linked GPO placeholder for future policy growth.

3/24/2026 - 7:29 AM |
Prepared WINCLIENT-01 for domain join.
Confirmed the LAB adapter kept the static 192.168.56.20 address and changed client DNS to 192.168.56.10 so the workstation could resolve the new Active Directory domain.

Ran into an issue regarding WINCLIENT-01 operating system.
Created New WINCLIENT-01 machine with Windows 11 Pro
