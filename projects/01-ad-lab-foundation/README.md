# Project 01 – AD Lab Foundation

## Overview

This project documents the Identity and Access phase of my cybersecurity homelab build. The goal of this phase was to transform the Windows Server system into a functioning domain controller, establish a basic Active Directory structure, create test identities, join the Windows client to the domain, and validate authentication across the lab.

This phase builds directly on the networking and VM deployment work completed in Project 00 and establishes the identity foundation required for future logging, monitoring, policy enforcement, and attack simulation work.

## Objectives

- Install Active Directory Domain Services on `DC-01`
- Promote `DC-01` to a domain controller
- Configure the lab domain and internal DNS
- Create organizational units, users, and groups
- Join `WINCLIENT-01` to the domain
- Validate domain authentication and policy application
- Document the build in a clean and repeatable way

---

## Environment Summary

### Host system
- Windows 11 desktop
- Oracle VirtualBox

### Virtual machines used in this phase
- `DC-01` – Windows Server 2022
- `WINCLIENT-01` – Windows 11
- `KALI-01` – Kali Linux
- `UBUNTU-01` – Ubuntu Server

### Domain configuration
- Domain: `lab.gregory-dean.com`
- NetBIOS: `LAB`
- Internal subnet: `192.168.56.0/24`

## Starting State

At the start of this phase, all four core virtual machines were already deployed and connected to the internal lab network from Project 00.

`DC-01` was prepared to become the first domain controller, while `WINCLIENT-01` was positioned to become the first domain-joined workstation.

## DC-01 Preparation

Before installing Active Directory, I verified the Windows Server configuration, hostname, IP addressing, and internal network settings.

## WINCLIENT-01 Domain Join

After Active Directory was ready, I prepared the Windows client by confirming its hostname, static internal IP, and DNS settings, then joined it to the lab domain.

## Cross-System Validation

`KALI-01` and `UBUNTU-01` were intentionally kept off-domain during this phase. They were used only to validate internal DNS resolution and network consistency from the Linux side of the lab.

## Key Outcomes

- Converted `DC-01` into a functioning domain controller
- Established the `lab.gregory-dean.com` lab domain
- Configured internal DNS to support Active Directory
- Created a basic OU structure for systems, users, and administration
- Added test users, security groups, and a dedicated admin account
- Joined `WINCLIENT-01` to the domain successfully
- Validated domain authentication and Group Policy processing
- Preserved `KALI-01` and `UBUNTU-01` as non-domain systems for future phases

## Notes

This phase focused only on identity and access management. It did not include SIEM deployment, log forwarding, attack simulation, Linux domain integration, or advanced hardening. Those tasks are planned for later projects.

I captured additional screenshots throughout the build to preserve validation evidence, system state, and troubleshooting history. The full image set is stored under `assets/images/phase-2-identity-and-access/` and a curated subset is used throughout this README to document the project flow.

---

## Next Phase

The next phase will focus on Monitoring and Detection by deploying a SIEM platform, onboarding Windows and Linux logs, validating ingestion, and building the first detection workflows.
