## Conventions

- **Screenshots:** Store under `projects/NN-<name>/images/` and reference from project READMEs as `images/<filename>`. Each active project has an `images/README.md` checklist.
- **Build logs:** Timestamped entries in each project's `notes.md` using the format below.
- **Credentials:** Store in a password manager or local secure store. Never commit passwords, API keys, or screenshots showing credentials. Review images before pushing to the repository.

### Notes Format

```markdown
# Build Notes - <Project Name>

## YYYY-MM-DD
