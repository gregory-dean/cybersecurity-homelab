# Cybersecurity Homelab

This repository documents the design, build process, and security experiments performed in my personal cybersecurity homelab.

The goal of this project is to build a controlled enterprise-style lab for practicing system administration, networking, detection engineering, vulnerability management, and attack simulation while documenting each phase in a structured and public-facing way.

The lab is continuously evolving as I expand the infrastructure and add new security tools and testing scenarios.

## Objectives

- Build a realistic enterprise-style security lab
- Practice both offensive and defensive security concepts
- Simulate attack activity in a controlled environment
- Generate and analyze logs across Windows and Linux systems
- Document the full build process for learning and portfolio development

### Internal Lab Network

- Subnet: `192.168.56.0/24`
- VirtualBox NAT used for outbound internet access
- VirtualBox Host-Only Adapter used for internal lab communication

See [docs/lab-architecture.md](docs/lab-architecture.md) for system roles and design goals.
